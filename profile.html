        My name is Emmanuel Ebikake Aputu. I am from Bayelsa state Nigeria. I
        studied engineering in school and decided to venture into graphic
        designs, illustrations and animations. I further had the need to venture
        into programming. Starting out with c-sharp, a programming language
        particularly good for creating games and desk top applications. Further
        down into my programming journey I ventured into pyhon. As a requirement
        to meet my goal for creating games and applications for education. i had
        to look into web related application. Desk top applications alone cannot
        meet the needs of all i wanted to reach. As a result, I had to go into
        HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, followed by third party applications such as
        REACT. and the related architechture.
